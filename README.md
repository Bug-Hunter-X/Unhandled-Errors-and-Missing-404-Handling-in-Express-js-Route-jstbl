# Express.js Error Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: insufficient error handling in route handlers. The `bug.js` file showcases a route that lacks proper error handling for database queries and missing resources. The `bugSolution.js` file provides an improved version with comprehensive error handling and clear responses.

## Bug

The original code lacks robust error handling.  Database errors are caught but a generic error message is provided without detail, and a missing user results in a 404 status code without a meaningful message. This can make debugging difficult and provide a poor user experience.

## Solution

The solution includes:

1. **Detailed error logging:**  Instead of generic error messages, detailed logging helps pin down the source of the error.  Production-ready code would use a proper logging library.
2. **Specific error handling:**  Different HTTP status codes are used to signal specific errors (404 for not found, 500 for server errors).
3. **Informative responses:** Error responses include helpful messages to aid debugging or inform the client of the issue.
4. **Input validation:** While not implemented here, adding input validation is crucial to prevent many potential problems.
